# Vapas Worker "Rustwrite Edition"
A rust rewrite of the Vapas Worker NodeJS server  to generate and deliver information for Native Depictions, 
Web Depictions, and other miscellaneous uses.

[**WE ARE NOW ON GITLAB!**](https://gitlab.com/vapas/vapas-worker/)

## Plan
The current plan is slowly rewrite each part of the Vapas worker in rust, as such the original JS files will be
hosted in this branch. When a "module" of the Vapas worker is rewritten, the original JS file for that module will be
removed.

## Running

NOTE: There is a getting started page on the Vapas confluence, please note this guide is still W.I.P and may change often.   
https://confluence.vapas.gq/display/WORKDOC/Getting+Started

You'll need the same ENV file as found on the NodeJS server, copy it over and it'll work just fine if you rename 
`SENTRYDSN` to `ROCKET_SENTRY_DSN`.  

Check the `.env.example` for everything required.
